\section{Mentorship}
I have mentored seven undergraduate students in bioinformatics, field biology, and molecular lab work. Three of these undergraduates published research with me as co-authors. Current positions of these students include veterinary school, hydrology technician, M.S. evol/ecol graduate school, undergraduate research assistant, and working on manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications.
